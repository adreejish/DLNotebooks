# DLNotebooks
Collection of Jupyter Notebook implementations from Deep Learning Papers I find interesting

To run locally:
   ```sh
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    jupyter notebook
   ```
Create a folder within the directory named datasets and add relevant datasets.
Please note that you're using Python3.7 and above
